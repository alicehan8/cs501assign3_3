## Assignment 3.3: LazyColumn with Sticky Headers

This app displays a contact list that is grouped alphabetically. The sample data for these contacts was generated by ChatGPT. 
It is formatted with a LazyList that allows for scrolling and sticky headers, which stay at the top as we are scrolling each group of contacts. 
When the user scrolls past 10 contacts, a floating action button to scroll to the top populates. Upon clicking the button, a coroutine is launched to animate scrolling to the top of the contact list. 

**Running the app:** Clone this repo in Android Studio and run an emulator
